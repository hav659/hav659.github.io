                    For this case study, our team set out to redesign the mobile version of the Minnesota Department of 
                    Health's COVID-19 response page. The MN DOH desktop website does a reasonable job sharing information, 
                    but is also crowded with its wealth of information. This problem is made significantly worse when on 
                    mobile alongside poor mobile elements. Our team of three shared the work as researchers, designers, 
                    and testers to create a much more accessible product.

                    User research included a number of interviews and a small survey. Interviews were aimed at people who 
                    had a variety of living situations and backgrounds. The primary focus of our research was discovering 
                    which information people found valuable and helpful as it relates to COVID-19, as the original website 
                    seemed to lack a priority amongst its information. Our research concluded that users wanted big-picture 
                    information without the politics. How bad are the current outbreaks? What is the progress on the vaccine?

                        After reviewing research, we created a proto-persona to help aid in defining our problem. Alongside a storyboard,
                        this persona helped focus our efforts. We aimed to make the most important and prominent information easily 
                        accessible, while making more obscure or situational information easier to find for those who need it.

                    Because our team was working within an established brand, we tried to stay as true to the established style 
                    as possible. Major changes were in iconography and headers streamline the flow of information. Our early wireframes 
                    put a major emphasis on cards containing easy-to-read icons.

                    The final prototypes took all previous research and design decisions and put them into a clean product. The critical,
                    real-time information users expressed interest in seeing were made easy to access. Large, simple icons in blue take
                    away any mystery as to where users are going. Recommending frequently asked questions in the search bar shortens the 
                    amount of time it takes users to find the information they critically need.

                    As COVID-19 is an ongoing virus with constantly-evolving situations, a well-designed website would require more 
                    agility to adapt to changing conditions. Live graphs and integrated Twitter feeds from medical officials are
                    a few ways the site could improve.<br><br>
                    Another direction the project could be taken is an overhaul to the desktop version of the site. Although
                    not as poor as the mobile site, the desktop site overwhelmed many users with cluttered information. Connecting 
                    the two sites to create a responsive site would also be a major priority in continued development.
